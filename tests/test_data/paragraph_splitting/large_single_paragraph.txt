This is a large single paragraph document with no paragraph breaks. It contains multiple sentences that should be grouped together intelligently. The text continues for many lines without any clear paragraph markers. This simulates a PDF that was extracted without proper formatting. Each sentence flows into the next without breaks. The goal is to split this into reasonable paragraphs while maintaining semantic coherence. Some sentences are longer than others. Some are quite short. The splitting algorithm should handle this variation. It should create paragraphs of reasonable size, not too small and not too large. The ideal paragraph size is between 500 and 1500 characters. This allows for good context while staying within API limits. The algorithm should group related sentences together. It should not split on every sentence boundary. Instead, it should look for natural breaks in the content. This might be topic changes or significant shifts in meaning. The current implementation has issues with over-segmentation. It creates too many tiny paragraphs. This document is designed to test whether the algorithm can handle large continuous text properly. It should create a reasonable number of paragraphs, not hundreds of tiny ones. The text continues here to make the document longer. More sentences are added to reach a substantial size. This helps test the splitting logic with realistic document sizes. The algorithm should be able to handle documents of various sizes. From small documents with just a few sentences to large documents with thousands of words. The key is intelligent grouping and reasonable size management. This is the end of the test document.

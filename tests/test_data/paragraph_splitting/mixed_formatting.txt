Chapter 1: Introduction

This is the introduction paragraph. It follows a chapter heading. The heading should be preserved but the paragraph should be grouped with it.

Section 1.1: Overview

The overview section contains important information. It has multiple sentences that form a coherent paragraph. The section heading should be handled appropriately.

1. First point in a numbered list. This should be grouped with other list items.
2. Second point continues the list. These items are related.
3. Third point completes the list. All points should be in one paragraph.

Regular paragraph text follows the list. It continues the discussion from the previous section.
